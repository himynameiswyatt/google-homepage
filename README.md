Attempting to create the Google homepage.

My reference page was an older version:

For only having 2-3 weeks worth of CSS knowledge, I'm pretty happy with the finished product.
Trying to use the align-content, align-self, and align-items commands rarely works for me... The apps icon (which is just an image because I'm not sure how to get proper icons yet) in the top nav bar is definitely not centered with the rest.
Everything else went pretty smooth and easy.
